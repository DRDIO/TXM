                        Counter-Notice. If you believe that your User Submission that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Submission, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Your physical or electronic signature;<br />
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, TXM.com may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at TXM.com's sole discretion.<br />
